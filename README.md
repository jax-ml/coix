Coix (COmbinators In jaX) is a flexible and backend-agnostic implementation of inference combinators [(Stites and Zimmermann et al., 2021)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.00668), a set of program transformations for compositional inference with probabilistic programs. Coix ships with backends for numpyro and oryx, and a set of pre-implemented losses and utility functions that allows to implement and run a wide variety of inference algorithms out-of-the-box.
